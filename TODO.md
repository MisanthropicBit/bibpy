# TODO

Below is a list of things that need to be improved/fixed in alpha and beta
states before `bibpy` 1.0.0 can be released.

- [ ] Speed up parsing (run `benchmark.py` to see current speed)
- [ ] Identify more cases for post- and preprocessing
- [ ] Bring coverage to 100%
- [ ] Handle file and string encodings across different Python versions
- [ ] Implement approximate matching for removing duplicate entries
