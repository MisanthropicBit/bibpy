# TODO

Below is a list of things that need to be improved/fixed in alpha and beta
states before `bibpy` 1.0.0 can be released.

- [x] Speed up parsing (run `benchmark.py` to see current speed) (switch to
      funcparserlib as default parser library)
- [x] Identify more cases for post- and preprocessing
- [ ] Bring coverage to 100%
- [x] Handle file and string encodings across different Python versions
- [ ] Implement approximate matching for removing duplicate entries
- [x] Implement a name splitter for authors etc.
- [ ] Implement codec for LaTeX/unicode
- [x] Remove dependency on pyparsing
